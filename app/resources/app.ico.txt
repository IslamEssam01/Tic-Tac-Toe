PLACEHOLDER ICON FILE

This file should be replaced with an actual app.ico file for the Windows application.

To create a proper icon:
1. Create a 32x32 or 64x64 pixel image with your application icon
2. Save it as app.ico format using an icon editor or online converter
3. Replace this text file with the actual app.ico file

For now, Windows will use the default application icon.

The icon should represent the Tic-Tac-Toe game - perhaps a simple grid with X and O symbols.

Recommended icon sizes to include in the .ico file:
- 16x16 pixels
- 32x32 pixels
- 48x48 pixels
- 64x64 pixels
- 128x128 pixels

This ensures the icon looks good at different display sizes and zoom levels.
